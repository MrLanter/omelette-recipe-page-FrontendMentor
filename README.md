## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS and SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to use SCSS and SASS and how to fix a bug with SCSS:

Since I was giving a link to the text font with
```
@font-face {
  src: url('../../')
}
```

When compiling the link was not good, so solution:
```
@font-face {
  src: url('/');
}
```
